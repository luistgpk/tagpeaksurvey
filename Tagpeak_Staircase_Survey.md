## 3. Staircase Trade-Off Exercise

**Progress indicator**: Step 3 of 5. Include animated staircase graphic climbing toward "Tagpeak Moment."  
**Goal**: Find the discount point where Tagpeak experiences outweigh classic savings.

### 3.1 Setup Scenario Card

- Present a consistent shopping scenario (e.g., "You're buying a pair of sneakers worth $150.").
- Highlight Tagpeak offer (e.g., "Unlock a curated weekend experience worth $Y or surprise access to Tagpeak lounges.").
- Clarify discount baseline: start at participant's anchored discount from Section 2.
- Display a side-by-side comparison panel:
  - **Option A**: Traditional discount (percentage adjusts per round).
  - **Option B**: Tagpeak benefit (experience descriptors, social proof snippet, value ladder graphic).

### 3.2 Adaptive Staircase Logic

1. **Round 1**: Offer Tagpeak vs. discount at the participant's stated anchor (e.g., 15%). Ask:  
   *"Would you choose the Tagpeak experience or keep the 15% discount?"
2. **Response Handling**:
   - If Tagpeak chosen â†’ Next round decreases discount by 3â€“5 percentage points.  
   - If Discount chosen â†’ Next round increases discount by 3â€“5 percentage points.  
   - Use max 6 rounds or until two reversals occur (classic staircase stopping rule).
3. **Adaptive Messaging**:
   - After each choice, show a micro-insight:  
     *"Interesting! Experience seekers like you often switch once the discount drops below 12%."*
   - Provide subtle encouragement:  
     *"Trust your gutâ€”where does Tagpeak start to feel more rewarding?"
4. **Completion Criteria**: Capture the last discount value at which the preference flipped. Record as "Tagpeak indifference point".
5. **Category Variation** (Optional): Repeat staircase for a second category (dining/night out) using fewer rounds to validate consistency.

## 4. Post-Decision Reflection

**Progress indicator**: Step 4 of 5.

1. **Emotional Aftertaste**  
   *Format*: Colorful semantic differential scale.  
   *Prompt*: "Choosing Tagpeak over a discount makes me feelâ€¦" (Anxious â†” Thrilled).  
   *Hint*: "We want Tagpeak to feel like a win, not a risk."

2. **Cognitive Fit**  
   *Format*: Matrix question (Agree/Neutral/Disagree).  
   *Statements*:  
   - "The Tagpeak offer felt tailored to me."  
   - "I trusted the value of the experience."  
   - "I worried I might regret skipping the discount."  
   *Microcopy*: Provide reinforcement ("If we missed the mark, tell us how!").

3. **Behavioral Intent**  
   *Format*: Slider with milestone icons.  
   *Prompt*: "How likely are you to choose Tagpeak in your next discretionary purchase?"  
   *Scale*: 0 (Never) to 10 (Definitely).  
   *Callout*: "Slide to 7+ and we'll unlock a teaser of upcoming perks."

**Goal**: Leave respondents feeling informed and valued.

1. **Personalized Summary Card**

   - Emotional driver insights (e.g., "Because you value feeling smart, we'll show you curated challenges that reward savvy choices.").
2. **Educational Nuggets**  
   - Carousel of 3 Tagpeak differentiators (e.g., exclusive experiences, social brag moments, instant access).  
   - Include real testimonials or aspirational statements.
3. **Advocacy Prompt**  
   - "Want first dibs on pilot invites?" with email capture or social follow buttons.  
   - Provide a skip option to maintain trust.

## Implementation Notes

- **Platform**: Use a survey tool that supports complex branching (Typeform, Qualtrics, or custom webform with adaptive logic).
- **Visual Design**: Stick to Tagpeak's color system, use soft gradients, round corners, micro-interactions, and subtle motion.
- **Copy Tone**: Conversational, optimistic, and empowering. Avoid jargon; emphasize feelings and experiences.
- **Testing**: Pilot with 20 users to ensure staircase logic converges quickly and microcopy keeps engagement high.
- **Incentives**: Offer a surprise Tagpeak perk upon completion to model the experiential reward.

---

### Optional Add-Ons

- **Dynamic Avatar**: Display a Tagpeak avatar that changes expression based on responses to create companionship.
- **Progress Badges**: Award mini badges ("Value Explorer", "Experience Pioneer") to celebrate milestones.
- **Scenario Randomization**: Rotate product categories to avoid monotony and test cross-category consistency.
