# Tagpeak Survey Toolkit

This repository houses a staircase-method survey blueprint designed to evaluate the psychological impact of Tagpeak compared to traditional cashback and discounts.

## Contents

- [`Tagpeak_Staircase_Survey.md`](Tagpeak_Staircase_Survey.md): End-to-end survey flow with design cues, adaptive logic, and analysis guidance.

## Getting Started

1. Review the survey blueprint to understand the respondent journey and data capture requirements.
2. Implement the flow in your preferred survey platform (Typeform, Qualtrics, or a custom web experience) ensuring the adaptive staircase logic is preserved.
3. Pilot test with a small audience, then iterate on copy, visuals, and branching based on engagement metrics.
