# Tagpeak Survey Experience

This repository contains a production-ready, staircase-method survey that helps the Tagpeak team measure when shoppers would trade a traditional percentage discount for experiential drops.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Adaptive six-round staircase flow that narrows in on each respondent's switching threshold.
- ðŸ§  Persona calibration and qualitative prompts that keep respondents engaged through the journey.
- ðŸ’¡ Insightful summary view that teams can export or discuss during campaign planning.
- ðŸš€ Built with Next.js 14 so it can be deployed instantly to Vercel or any Node-friendly hosting provider.
